##Files

The file "FindCent.txt" is the main code for the procedure.
The directory "TestCase" contains the files "E8setup.txt" and "CG7B.txt".



##Usage

To load the procedure into Magma, place the file FindCent.txt into a directory accessible to Magma and use the command 

load SPECIFYDIRECTORY/FindCent.txt


Alternatively you can simply copy and paste the contents of FindCent.txt directly into a Magma session.



##TestCase

A test case is provided to demonstrate the usage of the procedure. This test case involves the production of the centralizer of a 7B element in the finite group of Lie-type E8(2).

To use the test files, first begin a Magma session. Then load the file E8setup.txt, which constructs E8(2) as "G", followed by CG7B.txt, which provides a copy of the centralizer of a specific 7B element as "CG7B" (this is used only for the final step of comparison of module composition factors).

Next, choose a 7B element in G for which to construct the centralizer. For test purposes this can be a random 7B element - to find such an element search randomly in G for an element of order 7 with fixed space dimension 38 (the Magma command Dimension(Eigenspace(x,1)) gives the fixed space dimension of an element x).

Now load the main code FindCent.txt as described above, and then run using the command

FindCent(G,g,H,l,k,m,e)

For a successful run in this context we suggest the following parameter choices (note that "G" is already initialised as E8(2)):

g = the 7B element to be centralized
H = CG7B
l = 10
k = 3
m = 20
e = 20

Different parameter values can of course be experimented with, but these choices should produce a positive output within a few seconds. In particular, the choice of k = 3 is sensible as this is dimension of the smallest possible non-trivial irreducible GF(2)-module for a cyclic group of order 7.

After the procedure concludes, the output (i.e. the centralizer of g) is named "Cg". The procedure can easily be modified to a Magma function if desired.
